## My process

This time i tried what i found to be the most optimal way (so far).
I started setting up most of css variables and built the components first to match the layout, so when i started composing html
everything would be "pre-built" and the adjustments after that would be minimal.

That helped me a lot, i still had to change a few things here and there but overall increased the speed of process.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I mostly practiced my CSS Grid skills, image positioning (specially to let only the overflow-y on the top img) and responsivity.
